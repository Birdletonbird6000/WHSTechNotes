Speed, heading, and ambient light sensor.
Ambient light detects light between 30000 and 100000 lux. If the ambient light sensor is used in code, it is activated by shining a light at it, or just being in a bright place in general. The sensor would constantly need light to work.

Precision when coding is important since you could misplace or incorrectly type a line of code. One small mistake could cause all of your code to not work, or work incorrectly. It's good to pay attention early in coding in your coding journey to see which accidental mistakes you commonly make, so you learn to stop making those mistakes.

Computer science is important in learning as advances in computer science have allowed for good applications and technology to make it easier to teach. My life would be different without the advances of computer science as it could make specific things easier or harder to learn. Also i like to play games so they would be like less advanced.

Coding can help improve problem sovling skills by helping you understand to break down your problems into smaller steps, as it's harder to work on it all at once. Understanding coding can be important in industries that aren't directly related to using technology such as healthcare, finance, and education as you might need to know how to use programs or technological devices in order to work. Computer science can enhance creativity and collaboration by giving people more oppurtunites and the ability to be creative.
