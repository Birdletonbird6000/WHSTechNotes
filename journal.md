Speed, heading, and ambient light sensor.
Ambient light detects light between 30000 and 100000 lux. If the ambient light sensor is used in code, it is activated by shining a light at it, or just being in a bright place in general. The sensor would constantly need light to work.

Precision when coding is important since you could misplace or incorrectly type a line of code. One small mistake could cause all of your code to not work, or work incorrectly. It's good to pay attention early in coding in your coding journey to see which accidental mistakes you commonly make, so you learn to stop making those mistakes.

Computer science is important in learning as advances in computer science have allowed for good applications and technology to make it easier to teach. My life would be different without the advances of computer science as it could make specific things easier or harder to learn. Also i like to play games so they would be like less advanced.

The job I researched was computer programmer. Computer programmers test, write, and modify codes to create instructions allowing computer software and applications to function. To become it is important to know at least two of the following programming languages: SQL, Java, C++, or Python. You also need at least a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field. In this career, you can become a computer system analyst, a software developer, or a Database Administrator. This job aligns with my goals because I want to learn more coding or maybe be a software developer.

Coding can help improve problem sovling skills by helping you understand to break down your problems into smaller steps, as it's harder to work on it all at once. Understanding coding can be important in industries that aren't directly related to using technology such as healthcare, finance, and education as you might need to know how to use programs or technological devices in order to work. Computer science can enhance creativity and collaboration by giving people more oppurtunites and the ability to be creative.

AI can sometimes be good in updgrading industries, by automating processes, or making those processes easier. It can do processes like help in transportation. For example, AI can give us tips during specific situations while driving, for example, trains don't require much manually dedicated movement, as the path for it would already be created; instead AI could manage the speed of the trains and the amount of time it is like that. There are times AI could do some damage to industries. For example, AI often makes mistakes, and during important situations like automatically diagnosing someone. AI could also get some information wrong, which is why learning solely from AI is not a good idea.

Technology can influence elections using social media, where people post their opinions, and keep people up to date with new information. This can sometimes be bad as some people can lie to get people to vote differently and change their opinions. It can also be good as it is keeping people up to date about what happens. For example, it can show who would be winning the election, and the difference in votes between the canditates.

It is important to keep personal and sensitive information online, because sometimes you can get hacked or do research and find even more information about you. To keep your information safe, make difficult passwords to guess and write them down to not forget them. Also if you feel something is wrong with your account, you might want to reset your password often. One time when I accidently revealed too much information was when I was younger, I put my full name as my username but I deleted the account when I realized that it was a mistake. Don't ever share your password or too much personal information online.

An event that has happened is the election which will cause a large difference within the country. This does create changes that affect us all, as for the next few years, it is said that prices of products will change, and new laws may be created. This event can relate to our class, as we have been talking about problem-solving, just like how the new president will have to solve the problems of our country. | Advancements in technology plays a role in this important event, as it is constantly being used to distribute information. People have already used technology to state their opinions. Others have also tried to influence peoples' votes, hoping that it would help the side that their on win. Technology will continue to constantly contribute to these events in the future for more elections and other events like this.

Technology has made many changes to the way food is distributed, purchased, and stored. Technology has been constantly advancing and will make food more easily accessible this holiday season. This is becauses of new inventions, which makes producing crops more effiecient. For example, one of these creations is vertical farming. Vertical farming makes it easier to grow more crops with less water usage and less occpuation of space. Another one of these creations is lab-grown meat, which makes food with nutrition more accessible to more people, without making a large environmental impact. Robotics have been created, allowing food production to be more way more efficient. Drones have been used to monitor crops and provide important data to farmers. Smart appliances have made storing food easier, reducing food waste and energy consumption. This is some examples of newer technology, even though more inventions are constantly being created.

Currently, AI is being trained to act more human like, give better responses, and explain information better. This allows AI to be more trusted with important jobs. Jobs in industries such as healthcare, education, and finance can use AI to help businesses grow. AI would also be helpful in these industries as they can tell people what they would need to know. For example, AI could tell you how to treat symptoms if you are feeling sick. You could also ask it questions about specific topics, and you may learn something. This does concern me as it may not always be right, leading to mistreating sicknesses or giving incorrect facts about a topic. This may need to be taken into more consideration as technology evolves until it is confirmed to be correct almost all of the time.

To me, brainrot is content that harms people in some way, damaging mental health and attention span. Brainrot also is known for changing people's humor and the way they act or speak. I feel brainrot has a postitive impact on me this year because sometimes it can be funny, and connect people with similar humor because many people have seen brainrot content. Slop is usually AI-generated content that is unrealistic and targeted towards small children. This can cause harm as young children usually learn from what they watch. Popular TV shows such as Cocomelon would be considered slop, as it is meant for little kids, and the producers are able to keep children addicted to their screen, using vibrant colors and different clips every 2-3 seconds. The content does not teach them much at all and is really effective in reducing attention span, which could make it harder to learn as they get older. This is one example but there are more that are definetly worse. I don't watch content like this, myself, but I do often see it while scrolling.  Lore is usually thought of as the story to a series, game, or show. I do enjoy listening and learning more about my interests, as stories can be really entertaining. It is possible to benefit from social media while avoiding brainrot. Many apps use "algorithm", which is a method to find out what you like and what to recommend, just by what you search or watch. Avoiding brainrot will reduce the amount you see in the first place.

I think the switch from traditiional tech jobs to AI can have some good or bad changes. I think AI tools will enchance oppurtunities since they do not take as long to learn skills and would have really good memory after being developed for at least a certain amount of time. To prepare for a career in a fast-changing market, you could try to work a job that is hard to replace.

Government invtervention in technology can help regulate privacy and security. Too strict rules may negatively effect users or the amount of users. Tiktok could strengthen data security or explain how user data is collected and stored. If i worked at tiktok i would add a feature to show what kind of data is being collected to the user. The lesson you could learn would be to make sure you know what you are agreeing to.        This topic can relate to some of the jobs we talked about. Especially the types of jobs that create apps, or jobs that help or protect stored data.

  Technology has made aviation much safer. One improvement is air traffic control systems, which help planes and pilots talk to eachother. This allows people to know exactly where other planes are and allows them to avoid crashing into eachother. 
  AI can also make flying easier. They help pilots make smart choices when there is a issue. Relying too much on computers can be bad though because glitches or errors would be very dangerous. But technology could also help by describing issues in case a part of a plane might be breaking down and it would help people fix it. It is important to be careful with this kind of technology though because anyone trying to hack any airplane systems could cause a very big issue with communication during a flight or anything like that.

I learned about the partition of India in world geography. It is the division of British India into two independent states. It created different areas for people based on religion.

Technology can help people stay up to date with slang by asking other people online what it means, or just guessing what it means based off the rest of the text. Potential benefits of new slang makes it easier to talk or type faster and more efficiently, but some challenges may be that some people may not understand what some of the slang means. 
I think it is best to stay informal since it allows everyone to understand. I think the misunderstanding of new slang may impact interactions of adults and youth because some adults may find it uncessary and not bother to remember what some things mean, but youth might just use it anyways.

I think the classes on friday made it pretty easy for the substitute. I don't remember him getting upset or asking us to quiet down, so I think he didn't really have any problems with us. It was also a pretty easy job, since there was no assignment, and all he had to do was just watch us and not have to work or teach us anything. I think if we could go back we should have just been a little more quiet. also if ayden is yappig abt me dont believe him bc he is js trying to make his journal entry longer]['

The technology I used the most over the break was apps and games, and these are the most commonly used forms of technology. This entertained me because I was able to watch videos and play games and challenged me when I tested for a rank in  a game. | You can connect this technology to our classroom, as we use things such as apps and games for our assignments. They also require problem solving and knowledge of app functionality.

Currently i am ok and now worried about anything. The most stressful part about school is chemistry because its the hardest subject for me. Some things you can do to take care of yourself is sleep or spend some time alone. One goal I have for the rest of the school year is to get 90+ average in every class. No I don't have anyone to talk to when feeling overwhelmed so being by myself usually helps.

Technology has improved the tournaments. However, predicting the winners does take part off the fun away, like the unexpectedness and intensity during each game.      Social Media and streaming has changed how we watch. It allows us to watch the games online with friends and allows us to watch them anywhere. This makes March Madness feel more connected and fun.

I think an AI tutor could be the most useful for helping you to remember something. Even though the facts it provides are not always correct, it could remind you of specific strategies you used to do, but you since you've done it before, you'd know if it was right or wrong. AI can help you study by providing information and gives you the ability to learn more about a certain part, or summarize something a certain way. For example, asking an AI to summarize a topic in one paragraph is way easier to remember than an entire article. I would probably use it because I find it difficult to remember information recieved from many different sources.

I think that although cell phone bans could cause safety concerns, it would overall help the students with learning. Banning phones would cause a very significant amount of less distractions, and allows for more focus on school work. This could cause changes in student behavior, because students would find other ways to solve their bordeom. This would most likely cause more chatting between students, more people to get out of their seats, or just make people stay on their chromebooks for more time. It may cause safety concerns, as if there was a safety concerns, students may not be able to call for help. If this was implemented in my school, I would be so bored and probably just sneak it ngl.
