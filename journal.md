Speed, heading, and ambient light sensor.
Ambient light detects light between 30000 and 100000 lux. If the ambient light sensor is used in code, it is activated by shining a light at it, or just being in a bright place in general. The sensor would constantly need light to work.

Precision when coding is important since you could misplace or incorrectly type a line of code. One small mistake could cause all of your code to not work, or work incorrectly. It's good to pay attention early in coding in your coding journey to see which accidental mistakes you commonly make, so you learn to stop making those mistakes.

Computer science is important in learning as advances in computer science have allowed for good applications and technology to make it easier to teach. My life would be different without the advances of computer science as it could make specific things easier or harder to learn. Also i like to play games so they would be like less advanced.

The job I researched was computer programmer. Computer programmers test, write, and modify codes to create instructions allowing computer software and applications to function. To become it is important to know at least two of the following programming languages: SQL, Java, C++, or Python. You also need at least a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field. In this career, you can become a computer system analyst, a software developer, or a Database Administrator. This job aligns with my goals because I want to learn more coding or maybe be a software developer.

Coding can help improve problem sovling skills by helping you understand to break down your problems into smaller steps, as it's harder to work on it all at once. Understanding coding can be important in industries that aren't directly related to using technology such as healthcare, finance, and education as you might need to know how to use programs or technological devices in order to work. Computer science can enhance creativity and collaboration by giving people more oppurtunites and the ability to be creative.

AI can sometimes be good in updgrading industries, by automating processes, or making those processes easier. It can do processes like help in transportation. For example, AI can give us tips during specific situations while driving, for example, trains don't require much manually dedicated movement, as the path for it would already be created; instead AI could manage the speed of the trains and the amount of time it is like that. There are times AI could do some damage to industries. For example, AI often makes mistakes, and during important situations like automatically diagnosing someone. AI could also get some information wrong, which is why learning solely from AI is not a good idea.

Technology can influence elections using social media, where people post their opinions, and keep people up to date with new information. This can sometimes be bad as some people can lie to get people to vote differently and change their opinions. It can also be good as it is keeping people up to date about what happens. For example, it can show who would be winning the election, and the difference in votes between the canditates.

It is important to keep personal and sensitive information online, because sometimes you can get hacked or do research and find even more information about you. To keep your information safe, make difficult passwords to guess and write them down to not forget them. Also if you feel something is wrong with your account, you might want to reset your password often. One time when I accidently revealed too much information was when I was younger, I put my full name as my username but I deleted the account when I realized that it was a mistake. Don't ever share your password or too much personal information online.

An event that has happened is the election which will cause a large difference within the country. This does create changes that affect us all, as for the next few years, it is said that prices of products will change, and new laws may be created. This event can relate to our class, as we have been talking about problem-solving, just like how the new president will have to solve the problems of our country. | Advancements in technology plays a role in this important event, as it is constantly being used to distribute information. People have already used technology to state their opinions. Others have also tried to influence peoples' votes, hoping that it would help the side that their on win. Technology will continue to constantly contribute to these events in the future for more elections and other events like this.

Technology has made many changes to the way food is distributed, purchased, and stored. Technology has been constantly advancing and will make food more easily accessible this holiday season. This is becauses of new inventions, which makes producing crops more effiecient. For example, one of these creations is vertical farming. Vertical farming makes it easier to grow more crops with less water usage and less occpuation of space. Another one of these creations is lab-grown meat, which makes food with nutrition more accessible to more people, without making a large environmental impact. Robotics have been created, allowing food production to be more way more efficient. Drones have been used to monitor crops and provide important data to farmers. Smart appliances have made storing food easier, reducing food waste and energy consumption. This is some examples of newer technology, even though more inventions are constantly being created.
